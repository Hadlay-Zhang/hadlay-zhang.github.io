Hi! I'm a Master student in Computer Science at [NYU](https://engineering.nyu.edu). Previously, I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/). Currently, I'm working as a Research Intern at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu), advised by Prof. [Chenyu You](https://chenyuyou.me/index.html).

<p style="color: red;">I am actively looking for a 2026 Fall PhD position in US. Please reach out to me if you have relevant opportunities!</p>

Research Interests
======
My research interests focus on developing more capable and reliable AI systems through two directions:

a) **Multi-modal AI**, especially in the context of human-like perception and reasoning ability in different modalities (vision, language, audio...), and its application in the domains like Visual Question Answering, and Image Captioning.

b) **LLM-based Agents**, specifically multi-agent systems with dynamic communication protocols and task decomposition mechanisms that can collaborate and coordinate to solve complex real-world problems.
