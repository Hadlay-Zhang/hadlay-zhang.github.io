Hi! I am a final-year Master student in Computer Science at [New York University](https://engineering.nyu.edu). I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/). Currently, I'm working as a Research Intern at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu), advised by Prof. [Chenyu You](https://chenyuyou.me/index.html).

<p style="color: red;">🎈🎈 I am actively looking for a 2026 Fall PhD position in US.</p>

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on two directions:

- **Multimodal Learning**, especially in the context of multimodal reasoning and its application in subtasks like Visual Reasoning, Visual Question Answering and Visual Captioning.
- **LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems**, specifically collaborative multi-agent systems that enhance multimodal reasoning capabilities to decompose and solve complex real-world tasks, such as scientific workflows and medicine.
